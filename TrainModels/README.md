# Training the model

Now the time has finally come to train the model(s). This is fairly straightfoward. A model is defined by a set of parameters. These are specified in python, and some are the result of applying some processing steps to the data structures we so painfully have created in the previous steps.

`model1_s5r.py` gives an example of how the pipeline is specified from loading data to preprocessing it, training the classifiers, and writing them in the expected format to disk.
